            Fighting in Vietnam was an experience that would haunt him for the rest of his life.
            The new job will provide you with invaluable experience.
            We need someone who has experience in marketing and teaching, and I think Alex is just the woman for the job.
            A tour of Australia is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
            I know from past experience that you can't judge someone by their appearance.
            
            <h3>Senior Account Manager</h3>
            
            Senior account managers typically manage a portfolio of accounts and are responsible for building strong 
            client relationships, developing account management strategies, coordinating with internal teams to deliver 
            solutions that meet clients' needs, and identifying opportunities to grow accounts.

             A resume profile is a short summary of your work experience, skills, achievements, and goals. Itâ€™s a professional 
             introduction to your resume and it shows off your best qualities and how they relate to a specific job opening. 
             A resume profile is essentially a short cover letter.
